      <h1>Idea</h1>

      <p>
        In my first draft, I wanted to creat a recipe filter for those who live
        alone. However, while searching for methods to achieve this, I found
        that it's too challenging to have a large enough database that give a
        result meet each options made by user. Thus, I was thinking about making
        a simple starter recipe for kids to follow. There are many recipe online
        and most of them are full fo text and images, it's not easy for kids to
        read and focus. I try to make the process as simple as possile so that
        it's not intimidating for kids to start cooking and follow.

      <p>
        The biggest problem I met is not be able get the image I want according
        to the string input value i get from the users and stored in the local
        storage. After getting help in office hour, I follow the methods of
        creating an object which includes a list of objects. And then call on
        these objects by user input.

      <p>
        I feel it would be nice to improve the interface a little. Right now the
        interface is a little bit unclear. However, i spent to much time doing
        the technical part and doesn't have much time for css file.
