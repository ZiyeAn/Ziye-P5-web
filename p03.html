      <h1>Idea</h1>

      <p>
        In my first draft, I wanted to creat a recipe filter for those who live
        along. However, while searching for methods to achieve this, I found
        that it's too challenging to have a large enough database

      <h1>Sketch & Process</h1>
      <p>
        After I decided to make website showing different cultural perspectives
        of apples, I startes to find the meanings adn symbolizations of apple in
        different culture, I refered a lot on an essay called
        <a
          href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317574213_The_Motif_of_Apple_in_Different_Cultures_and_Its_Usage_in_Anatolian_Folk_Songs"
          >"THE MOTIF OF APPLE IN DIFFERENT CULTURES AND ITS USAGE IN ANATOLIAN
          FOLK SONGS1" by Ahmet Emre Dağtaşoğlu</a
        >
        and based on this article, I created these drawings I used for my
        website. I originally had two ideas, shown in the image below. First is
        to have a fixed background and let the apple change according to
        artistic styles of different places. Second is to have apple cutted into
        slices and each slice of them is representing a specific culture. In my
        final work, I basicaly combine these two ideas.

      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p>
        I really enjoy designing the website without considering too much on
        porfessional side like typeface, layout and so on. I feel like I am just
        designing an artistic book with digital tools. :) <br />
        Something I wanted to improve more might be the interactive part. I want
        to include more animation and movement in this website. For example, on
        the main page, It would be nice to have sounds effect added while it is
        scrolled to the knife part. Or having some effect while clicking on the
        apple slices.
