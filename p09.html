      <h1>Project concept</h1>
      <p>
        I wanted to continue with the collage style so that I choose to use the
        collage-sence font. To make it look more complete, I used switch()
        function to separate the starting interface and the camera following the
        template given by Munus. ot amke it look more playful and consistent, I
        make a gif to make it move.
      </p>
      <h1>Some thouhghts</h1>
      <p>
        For the buttons, in order to achieve better look, I decided to use p5.play
        library and using sprite to create better button that fits the style. Even though the styles can be chanegd with css, i still felt it pretty limited since i couldn
        't really change'

      <h1>Reflection and Thoughts</h1>
      <p>
        I think it would be nicer if it could detect that the face is turning
        and then i could creat a profile version of all the facial parts. Also,
        it would be cool if it can detect the backgroung and added collaged
        backhground.
