      <h1>Project concept</h1>
      <p>
        This project is created based on the experimental camera i created last
        week. I wanted to continue with the collage style so that I choose to
        use the collage-sence font. To make it look more complete, I used
        switch() function to separate the starting interface and the camera
        following the template given by Munus. ot amke it look more playful and
        consistent, I make a gif to make it move.
      </p>
      <h1>Some thouhghts</h1>
      <p>
        For the buttons, in order to achieve better look, I decided to use
        p5.play library and using sprite to create better button that fits the
        style. Even though the styles can be chanegd with css, i still felt it
        pretty limited since i couldn 't really change the appearnce of that box
        and the fonts are also limietd compared to p5. js which allows for any
        font I uploaded.\n Besides, it is sort of suprising for me to find that
        consentful interface can be artistic if you spend time to design. The
        consentful interface I saw before are usually very dull and serious.
      </p>

      <h1>Reflection and Thoughts</h1>
      <p>
        As a user, i still wanted to see more websites that has clear consentful
        interface adn allows uses to choose at any time. The clear intruction
        makes me feel respected and safer in this digital age. Espicially the
        acquirement of camera, i think the aquirement of camera need to be
        inturcted any time.
