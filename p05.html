      <h1>Optical Illusion</h1>

      <p>
        Move the position of mouse to rotate the circular patterns and the
        nine-tailed fox.<br />
        Nine-tailed fox is a mythological animal in a Chinese ancient literature
        called Shanhaijin 山海经, which records many mysterious animals in
        folklore. This project is inspired both by this book and the album cover
        of my recent favorite song 'lil Goldfish'. The circular and regular
        pattern on the cover is pretty suitable for loop() function. I also like
        how sec() works to control rotation from last project so I also utilize
        it in this project. It's hard to use code to draaw the fox so I draw
        several frames with procreate and upload them to p5js.

      <div class="fullwidth">

      </div>

      <p>
        It is pretty challenging to use loop and sometimes it confuesd me. I
        also tried to use a self-customized function in that function to create
        more complicated illustion, it works like a matryoshka doll, which
        offers me a broader use of customized function. Drawing several frames
        for the fox is the most time-consuming part. It's harder than expected
        to draw the action of wagging the tails smoothly. It would be better if
        I could have time to draw more frames. Besides, I also erperimented with
        texture using blendmode() this time in order ot give the mythological
        feeling and it worked quite well.

        I like this kind of style a lot and i was planning to expand on this
        theme a little bit more, maybe even combinning with arduino.
