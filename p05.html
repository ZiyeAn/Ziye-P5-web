        I was inpired by the album cover of my recent favorate song Lil'
        goldfish, the circular and regular pattern is pretty suitable for loop()
        function. I also like how sec() works to control rotation from last
        project so I also utilize it in this project. It's hard to use code to
        draaw the fox so I draw several frames with procreate and upload them to
        p5js.

        It is pretty challenging to use loop and sometimes it confuesd me. I
        also tried to use a self-costumized function in that function to create
        more complicated illustion, it works like a matryoshka doll. Drawing
        several frames for the fox is also time-consuming. It would be better if
        I could have time to draw more frames. I also erperimented with texture
        this time using blendmode() this time.
