      <h1>Project concept</h1>
      <p>
        I wanted to create the sence of collage using camera and face tracking
        library. The collage can be switched by clicking the mouse. All the
        images are sourced from the classical works in different styles.I
        cropped the eyes, mouths, and other different parts from the images and
        make them display randomly. Besides, to enhance the sence of collage, I
        added a paper texture to this sketch
      </p>
      <h1>Designs and Sources</h1>
      <p>
        Below are all the images I used for the sketch. I select painting and
        cropped them for each facial features and added them to each array and
        finally use random() to call on these arraies.I use the face

        and use the points coordinates for these images.

      <h1>Reflection and Thoughts</h1>
      <p>
        I think it would be nicer if it could detect that the face is turning
        and then i could creat a profile version of all the facial parts. Also,
        it would be cool if it can detect the backgroung and added collaged
        backhground.
