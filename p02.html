      <h1>Idea</h1>

      <p>
        In this project, I wanted to explore different cultural perspective of
        an apple. I choose apple as my subject mainly because that is a fruit I
        think is normal but my mom always push me to eat. She never stop
        bragging how good it is to eat apples, so I wanted to figure out how
        poeple from the world view this normal fruit. I also include how I view
        it at the final section cuz I want also a private perspective of
        apples.<br />
        The childish and handwritten art style is specifically chosen and
        referenced on my childhood diary. I remembered even thhough I hated it
        so much but as a kid I have no power to reject eating apples so I could
        only curse apples secretly in my diary.

      <h1>Sketch</h1>

      <p>
        I wanted to make a poem that is telling the story in linear narrative.
        Thus, I didn't design a lot of pages. Since the poet is using oak tree
        and ceiba tree as the metaphoric sybol for the position of two people in
        a relationship, I wanted to visualize that so I use hands as
        representations. Besides, I don't want too many words showing directly,
        so I want to make the veins clickable and showing the poem after
        clicking the veins.<br />
        I changed my idea a lot while making the website. I discovered that my
        original design can't really show the interacticity of the website.
        Thus, I decided to change from this linear forms of website into
        something that offers more options. The content of the peom leads me to
        think of the branches of the tree, i decided to replace branced with
        poem lines and thus enable users to click into these words and check the
        poem. I don't wanted to present all the lines and words directly on the
        website and I wanted more interaction so I check how to have words over
        images while hovering on

      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p>
        I really enjoy designing the website without considering too much on
        porfessional side like typeface, layout and so on. I feel like I am just
        designing an artistic book with digital tools. :) <br />
        Something I wanted to improve more might be the interactive part. I want
        to include more animation and movement in this website. For example, on
        the main page, It would be nice to have sounds effect added while it is
        scrolled to the knife part. Or having some effect while clicking on the
        apple slices.
