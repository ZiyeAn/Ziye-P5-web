      <h1>Idea</h1>

      <p>
        In this project, I wanted to explore different cultural perspective of
        an apple. I choose apple as my subject mainly because that is a fruit I
        think is normal but my mom always push me to eat. She never stop
        bragging how good it is to eat apples, so I wanted to figure out how
        poeple from the world view this normal fruit. I also include how I view
        it at the final section cuz I want also a private perspective of
        apples.<br />
        The childish and handwritten art style is specifically chosen and
        referenced on my childhood diary. I remembered even thhough I hated it
        so much but as a kid I have no power to reject eating apples so I could
        only curse apples secretly in my diary.<br />
        I used only grid for my pages since I like how it is more fixed that
        flexbox. I utilized it for decoration and page-switching menu. In the
        home page, I used it to add stars on two sides of the apple slices. In
        those subpages, I use them to create a small page-switching interface at
        the very bottom. Since I wanted this website to be more childlike and
        diary-like, I decided to use as less text as possible and make all the
        subpages looks more unified in forms, so I didn't change the way I use
        flexbox a lot in each subpage.

      <h1>Sketch & Process</h1>
      <p>
        After I decided to make website showing different cultural perspectives
        of apples, I startes to find the meanings adn symbolizations of apple in
        different culture, I refered a lot on an essay called
        <a
          href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317574213_The_Motif_of_Apple_in_Different_Cultures_and_Its_Usage_in_Anatolian_Folk_Songs"
          >"THE MOTIF OF APPLE IN DIFFERENT CULTURES AND ITS USAGE IN ANATOLIAN
          FOLK SONGS1" by Ahmet Emre Dağtaşoğlu</a
        >
        and based on this article, I created these drawings I used for my
        website. I originally had two ideas, shown in the image below. First is
        to have a fixed background and let the apple change according to
        artistic styles of different places. Second is to have apple cutted into
        slices and each slice of them is representing a specific culture. In my
        final work, I basicaly combine these two ideas.

      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p>
        I really enjoy designing the website without considering too much on
        porfessional side like typeface, layout and so on. I feel like I am just
        designing an artistic book with digital tools. :) <br />
        Something I wanted to improve more might be the interactive part. I want
        to include more animation and movement in this website. For example, on
        the main page, It would be nice to have sounds effect added while it is
        scrolled to the knife part. Or having some effect while clicking on the
        apple slices.
