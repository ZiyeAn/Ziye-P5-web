      <h1>Design Process</h1>

      <p>
        First, I designed a journal in the form of an svg so that i could use
        the 'secret tool' provided by Munus, However, I met problems while
        converting the svg into p5.js code. Then with the suggestion of Munus, I
        switch to Figma and succesfully convert the drawing.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.global/37ceb013-f438-4f12-b04d-aa6a3298d270/Process1.png?v=1694453200273"
          alt="Process"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        In order to reach the effect of pages being torn off, I created two
        layers of pages inside the journal so it won't look wierd when the
        yellow sheet of paper were moved away. The I try to find the group of
        code that correspond to the part I wanted and then adding transltate()
        and rotate(). The most chaallenging part is the since the code is
        generated by the converter, it is quite hard to change the coordinates
        of the curves so that using translate and rotate together is not that
        successful.
      </p>

      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p>
        If the path could be more simply, it might be easier for me to find the
        group of codes I want and the coordinates of curves could be less for me
        to revise in order to use translate().Also, the effect of tearing the
        page of the journal is a bit of rigid. Hopefullig i could make it looks
        better after learning more.
