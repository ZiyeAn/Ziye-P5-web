      <p>
        Background Story<br />
        This is a cruel expriment done by aliens, they tried to modify
        themselves and to test how powerful they could be, they even capture
        angels and banana and include them in their experiment! They make banana
        alive by letting them eat a kind of sausages which are made of their
        family members. To see if merging their DNA with angel can make them
        stronger, they spent centuries to find the trace of angel, a race only
        live in the myth. They mercilessly skin angel and only keep their brain
        and skeleton and then, merge themselves with banana and angels.

        I initially planned to create a slot machine-like appearance by
        designing a border and separating the top, middle, and bottom parts of
        the figures. However, I was unable to successfully replicate the
        spinning motion of a slot machine, i can't make images in array spins
        one after another. I attempted to find tutorials on
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPFJROWdkQ8&t=565s"
          >An Array of Images Processing Tutorial
        </a>
        , but I still couldn't achieve the desired result.I also found another
        slot machine code on
        <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1897529">open processing</a>
        which show the spinning effect by creating a array and put images show
        the interval of two objects and pretend that it is spinning. I didn't
        utilize this cuz I think it's lame. I tried to write down the pusedo
        code I need for the spinning effect but it didn't work out. But it shows
        how I want the animation to operate. I also use costomized funtion for
        creating the combinition. It was very useful. I searched some other code
        about slot machine but many of them uses html. to do it which i couldn't
        quite understand. Additionally, I didn't use code to draw these images
        because I wanted to create an array and make the images move like a slot
        machine which using images is easier and better. Furthermore, some of
        the designs I received were not suitable for code implementation or
        display.

        I want to fix the spinning part during class or book an office hour.

      <p>
        I searched but didn't use any code I found so I think I don't really
        need to credit anything?
