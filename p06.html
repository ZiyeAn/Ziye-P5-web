      <p>
        The data visualization reveals the frequency with which I turn on my
        phone and mindlessly scroll through the interface. I've noticed that
        I've become accustomed to this behavior, even when I don't have a
        specific purpose for using my phone. I find this automatic action
        intriguing and aim to convey it through the frequency of these actions
        and the audible 'click' sound, which somewhat reflects a sense of
        emptiness.

        I struggled a lot while using array to create all these hands. In
        previous attempts, while I changed the speed, all the speed of the hands
        would change since they are still sharing the x position. Thus, I
        created several more arraies to separate them. I looked up some solution
        and I found it seems like class is a suitable solution for this yet it's
        pretty challenging to figure it out by myself so I continued with this solution.

        I want to fix the spinning part during class or book an office hour.

      <h1>Credits</h1>

      <p>
        I searched but didn't use any code I found so I think I don't really
        need to credit anything?
