      <p>
        The data visualization reveals the frequency with which I turn on my
        phone and mindlessly scroll through the interface. I've noticed that
        I've become accustomed to this behavior, even when I don't have a
        specific purpose for using my phone. I find this automatic action
        intriguing and aim to convey it through the frequency of these actions
        and the audible 'click' sound, which somewhat reflects a sense of
        emptiness.

        I initially planned to create a slot machine-like appearance by
        designing a border and separating the top, middle, and bottom parts of
        the figures. However, I was unable to successfully replicate the
        spinning motion of a slot machine, i can't make images in array spins
        one after another. I attempted to find tutorials on
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPFJROWdkQ8&t=565s"
          >An Array of Images Processing Tutorial
        </a>
        , but I still couldn't achieve the desired result.I also found another
        slot machine code on
        <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1897529">open processing</a>
        which show the spinning effect by creating a array and put images show
        the interval of two objects and pretend that it is spinning. I didn't
        utilize this cuz I think it's lame. I tried to write down the pusedo
        code I need for the spinning effect but it didn't work out. But it shows
        how I want the animation to operate. I also use costomized funtion for
        creating the combinition. It was very useful. I searched some other code
        about slot machine but many of them uses html. to do it which i couldn't
        quite understand. Additionally, I didn't use code to draw these images
        because I wanted to create an array and make the images move like a slot
        machine which using images is easier and better. Furthermore, some of
        the designs I received were not suitable for code implementation or
        display.

        I want to fix the spinning part during class or book an office hour.

      <h1>Credits</h1>

      <p>
        I searched but didn't use any code I found so I think I don't really
        need to credit anything?
