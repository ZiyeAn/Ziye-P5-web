      <h1>Game Concept</h1>
      <p>
        This game is showing my story with my dog, XiaoWu小五, who unfortunately
        died because of kidney failure last year. I want to use this game to
        record my memory with him. I always had the dream of being a witch and I
        would like to pretend that I am witch in Harry Potter and Xiowu being my
        spiritual animals. I also borrow the idea of pensieve from Harry Potter
        and used it as the way of telling my autobiographical story.
      </p>
      <h1>Design and Greybox</h1>
      <p>
        I draw a story board and make a very simple greybox. Yet I directly
        revised on the grey box so I don't have the grey box sketch anymore.

        <h1>Reflection and Thoughts</h1>
        <p></p>
        I drew a lot of assets for the game and they are reference on a
        halloween pixel art by artist Pixel Jeff. I also use sound from
        zapslpat. The biggest difficulty I met is the p5.play library. It is
        pretty confusing sometimes and I get help from Munus a lot. It's also quite hard to arrange all these codes.
