      <h1>Poem</h1>

      <p>
        致橡树 To the Oak Tree <br />作者：舒婷 By Shu Ting <br />如果爱你—— If
        I love you -- <br />绝不像攀援的凌霄花 I will never be a clinging
        trumpet creeper<br />
        借你的高枝炫耀自己 Using your high boughs to show off my height<br />
        我如果爱你—— If I love you -- <br />绝不学痴情的鸟儿 I will never be a
        spoony bird<br />为绿荫重复单调的歌曲 Repeating a monotonous song for
        green shade <br />也不止像泉源 Or be a spring <br />常年送来清凉的慰藉
        Bringing cool solace all year long <br />也不止像险峰 Or be a steep peak
        <br />增加你的高度，衬托你的威仪 Increasing your stature, reflecting
        your eminence <br />甚至日光 Even the sunlight <br />甚至春雨 Even the
        spring rain <br />不，这些都还不够 No, all these are not enough
        <br />我必须是你近旁的一株木棉 I must be a ceiba tree beside you
        <br />作为树的形象和你站在一起 Be the image of a tree standing together
        with you <br />根，紧握在地下 Our roots, entwined underground
        <br />叶，相触在云里 Our leaves, touching in the clouds <br />每一阵风过
        With each gust of wind <br />我们都互相致意 We greet each other
        <br />但没有人 But nobody <br />听懂我们的言语 Can understand our words
        <br />你有你的铜枝铁干 You'll have your copper branches and iron trunk
        <br />像刀、像剑，也像戟 Like knives, like swords, like halberds, too
        <br />我有我的红硕花朵 I'll have my crimson flowers <br />像沉重的叹息
        Like heavy sighs <br />又像英勇的火炬 And valiant torches
        <br />我们分担寒潮、风雷、霹雳 We'll share cold spells, storms and
        thunder <br />我们共享雾霭、流岚、虹霓 We'll share mists, hazes and
        rainbows <br />仿佛永远分离 Seemingly always apart <br />却又终身相依
        But also forever interdependent <br />这才是伟大的爱情 Only this can be
        great love <br />坚贞就在这里 The loyalty is here <br />爱—— Love --
        <br />不仅爱你伟岸的身躯 I love not only your strapping stature
        <br />也爱你坚持的位置，足下的土地 But also your firm stand, the earth
        beneath you

      <h1>Sketch</h1>

      <p>
        I wanted to make a poem that is telling the story in linear narrative.
        Thus, I didn't design a lot of pages. Since the poet is using oak tree
        and ceiba tree as the metaphoric sybol for the position of two people in
        a relationship, I wanted to visualize that so I use hands as
        representations. Besides, I don't want too many words showing directly,
        so I want to make the veins clickable and showing the poem after
        clicking the veins.<br />
        I changed my idea a lot while making the website. I discovered that my
        original design can't really show the interacticity of the website.
        Thus, I decided to change from this linear forms of website into
        something that offers more options. The content of the peom leads me to
        think of the branches of the tree, i decided to replace branced with
        poem lines and thus enable users to click into these words and check the
        poem. I don't wanted to present all the lines and words directly on the
        website and I wanted more interaction so I check how to have words over
        images while hovering on

      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p>
        I found that the biggest prolem is the size and the position of the
        element on website in windows of different size. It's hard to keep the
        text on the right place in different windows. Besides, it's hard to get
        a very fluent change by just using css, I really wanted some movement
        and motion for the elements on the website and what I achieved is still
        a little bit rigid.<br />
        Another challenge is that I haven't really get used to the mindset of
        designing a website. I tend to design it like deisigning a book but not
        an interactive website. And it's a little bit hard for me to visualize
        my ideas.
